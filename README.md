# MicroRNA-Gene-Network-Colon

The MicroRNA-Gene-Network-Colon provides a new strategy to for integrating microRNA andgene expression profiles together with clinical information toward understandingthe regulation of colon cancer. 

Jia Wen, Benika Hall and Xinghua Shi. A Network View of MicroRNA and GeneInteractions in Different Pathological Stages ofColon Cancer. BMC Medical Genomics 2018 (In submit).

The bc_matrix.txt includes the miRNA expression data and the pathological data.

The depository of Scripts includes R scripts to conduct the network analysis using microRNA and gene expression profiles on pathological stages of colon cancer. This new strategy can be applied to various cancer subtypes.

The depository of Results includes the network results for four pathological stages and the statistical test results of colon cancer.
